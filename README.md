IDEAS
-----

* Private calendar view for events, only visible to users with accounts who can publish 'regional' events. This can be used as a 'proposed events' view to help avoid future schedule collisions
* If 'community events' are supported (not a regional / decom / burning pub night), maybe they only show up when map is zoomed in to a particular depth (city level)
